> **Note**
> While this project is currently dormant, I do intend to revisit it at some point in time. There's a general lack of WP themes that make building on the platform quick and straightforward for developers that are used to the more full-featured frameworks such as Laravel, and it would be cool to fill that space. However, other projects are currently taking priority, so this project is largely dormant. If you feel motivated to do so, feel free to steal this work and continue the project.

WP Elemental is a base theme to build beautiful websites on top of. It aims to provide you with minimal clean markdown, while also providing a suitable framework for the most common elements of Wordpress websites.

This project is in early development, use at your own risk. Please post feature requests or bug reports in the issues for this repository.
